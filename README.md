# Abstract-Models-Of-Computation-2024-2025
This repository contains all the assignments completed during the 2024/2025 Abstract Models of Computation EHU/UPV course. All the code is written in Python :P

Overview

The **Abstract Models of Computation** course explores theoretical foundations of computing. The course covers various models and techniques used to understand computational problems, the complexity of algorithms, and the limits of computation. Key topics include:

- Turing Machines
- Computability and Complexity Theory
- NP-completeness and P vs NP problem

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Abstract-Models-Of-Computation-2024-2025.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the specific lab** you are working on and read the `README.md` inside that folder for instructions on how to run the code and perform the exercises.

3. **Run the code**: 
   Most of the code is written in Python. You can execute the files from the command line or use your preferred IDE.

   Example of running a Python file:
   ```bash
   python3 Lab01_FiniteAutomata/finite_automata.py
   ```

4. **Testing**:
   Each lab comes with test scripts (using `unittest` or similar) to validate your solutions. Run the tests like this:
   ```bash
   python3 Lab01_FiniteAutomata/test_finite_automata.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional libraries for specific labs (check the README of each lab folder for specific requirements).
